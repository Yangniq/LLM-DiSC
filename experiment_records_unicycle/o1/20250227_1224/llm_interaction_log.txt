System:

You are an expert in designing controllers. Your task is to: 
- Analyze the given prompt and design a controller for the agent based on the provided information. 
- Implement the controller in Python, adhering to the specific format given in the prompt. 
- Ensure the controller enables the agent to avoid obstacles and other agents while successfully reaching its target.


User:

There are `10` homogeneous agents, each with a radius of `0.25`. The agents follow the dynamics $\dot{\boldsymbol{x} } =f(\boldsymbol{x}) + g(\boldsymbol{x}) \boldsymbol{u}$, where $\boldsymbol{x} = [p_x, p_y,\theta]$ represents the agent's position $(p_x,p_y)$ and orientation $\theta$ in a 2D space, and $\boldsymbol{u} = [v, \omega]$ represents the control inputs, with $v$ as the linear velocity and $\omega$ as the angular velocity. The initial states of the agents are`[[1.5, 0.5, 1.57], [3.5, 0.5, 1.57], [4.5, 0.5, 1.57], [6.5, 0.5, 1.57], [8.5, 0.5, 1.57], [9.5, 0.5, 1.57], [11.5, 0.5, 1.57], [14.5, 0.5, 1.57], [15.5, 0.5, 1.57], [18.5, 0.5, 1.57]]`, with their initial controls are `[[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Each agent has a known target point at `[[18, 19], [17, 19], [15, 19], [12, 19], [10, 19], [9, 19], [7.5, 19], [5, 19], [3, 19], [1, 19]]` (stop moving when the agent reaches the target point or gets sufficiently close to it). The positions of the obstacles are given as `[[(15.2, 8.3), (16.6, 12.0), (12.8, 12.6), (12.3, 11.9), (12.4, 9.0), (15.2, 8.3)], [(3.3, 6.8), (7.9, 6.3), (8.9, 7.6), (4.2, 8.0), (3.3, 6.8)], [(15.8, 2.5), (13.2, 6.4), (14, 3.2), (15.8, 2.5)], [(7.2, 11.2), (4.2, 17.4), (4.2, 12.0), (7.2, 11.2)], [(0.9, 5.2), (0.2, 3.2), (1.2, 1.8), (2.4, 1.3), (0.9, 5.2)], [(17.5, 6.1), (19.4, 5.3), (19.8, 5.8), (18.1, 6.1), (17.5, 6.1)]]`, each sublist represents the vertices of a polygon, with each vertex stored in the form of `(x, y)`. The last vertex is the same as the first, indicating a closed polygon.

Please help design a controller and implement it as Python function. The function should output the control input signal needed to update the agent's state. The time interval for the agent's state update is `0.05`. The function should return the control signal. Please design the controller using the following Python function structure and do not need the `example usage`:

```
def get_control(index,all_state,all_ctrl,target_pos,obs_pos,agent_R, state_info):
        # Your code to compute the control input
        return control_input
```
Where:

- 'index' is the agent index, starting from 0.
- 'all_state' is the current state of all the agents in the format [[x1, y1,theta1], [x2, y2,theta2], ...].
- 'all_ctrl' is the control signal of the agent in the format [[v1, omega1], [v2, omega2], ...].
- 'target_pos' is the target position of the agent in the format [x, y].
- 'obs_pos' is a list containing the vertex coordinates of multiple polygons, formatted as [[(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(x1,y1)],[...],...]. Each sublist represents the vertices of a polygon, the last vertex is the same as the first, indicating a closed polygon.
- 'agent_R' is the radius of the agent.
- 'state_info' is the state change of all agents from the initial moment to the current moment, formatted as [[[x11, y11,theta11], [x12, y12,theta12],...], [[x21, y21,theta21], [x22, y22,theta22],...],...]. (For example, `state_info[index]` records the state change of the agent `index` from the initial moment to the current moment.)
