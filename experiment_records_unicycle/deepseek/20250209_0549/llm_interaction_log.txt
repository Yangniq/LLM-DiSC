System:

You are an expert in designing controllers. Your task is to: 
- Analyze the given prompt and design a controller for the agent based on the provided information. 
- Implement the controller in Python, adhering to the specific format given in the prompt. 
- Ensure the controller enables the agent to avoid obstacles and other agents while successfully reaching its target.


User:

There are `10` homogeneous agents, each with a radius of `0.25`. The agents follow the dynamics $\dot{\boldsymbol{x} } =f(\boldsymbol{x}) + g(\boldsymbol{x}) \boldsymbol{u}$, where $\boldsymbol{x} = [p_x, p_y,\theta]$ represents the agent's position $(p_x,p_y)$ and orientation $\theta$ in a 2D space, and $\boldsymbol{u} = [v, \omega]$ represents the control inputs, with $v$ as the linear velocity and $\omega$ as the angular velocity. The initial states of the agents are`[[1.5, 0.5, 1.57], [3.5, 0.5, 1.57], [4.5, 0.5, 1.57], [6.5, 0.5, 1.57], [8.5, 0.5, 1.57], [9.5, 0.5, 1.57], [11.5, 0.5, 1.57], [14.5, 0.5, 1.57], [15.5, 0.5, 1.57], [18.5, 0.5, 1.57]]`, with their initial controls are `[[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Each agent has a known target point at `[[18, 19], [17, 19], [15, 19], [12, 19], [10, 19], [9, 19], [7.5, 19], [5, 19], [3, 19], [1, 19]]` (stop moving when the agent reaches the target point or gets sufficiently close to it). The positions of the obstacles are given as `[[(15.2, 8.3), (16.6, 12.0), (12.8, 12.6), (12.3, 11.9), (12.4, 9.0), (15.2, 8.3)], [(3.3, 6.8), (7.9, 6.3), (8.9, 7.6), (4.2, 8.0), (3.3, 6.8)], [(15.8, 2.5), (13.2, 6.4), (14, 3.2), (15.8, 2.5)], [(7.2, 11.2), (4.2, 17.4), (4.2, 12.0), (7.2, 11.2)], [(0.9, 5.2), (0.2, 3.2), (1.2, 1.8), (2.4, 1.3), (0.9, 5.2)], [(17.5, 6.1), (19.4, 5.3), (19.8, 5.8), (18.1, 6.1), (17.5, 6.1)]]`, each sublist represents the vertices of a polygon, with each vertex stored in the form of `(x, y)`. The last vertex is the same as the first, indicating a closed polygon.

Please help design a controller and implement it as Python function. The function should output the control input signal needed to update the agent's state. The time interval for the agent's state update is `0.05`. The function should return the control signal. Please design the controller using the following Python function structure and do not need the `example usage`:

```
def get_control(index,all_state,all_ctrl,target_pos,obs_pos,agent_R, state_info):
        # Your code to compute the control input
        return control_input
```

Where:

- 'index' is the agent index, starting from 0.
- 'all_state' is the current state of all the agents in the format [[x1, y1,theta1], [x2, y2,theta2], ...].
- 'all_ctrl' is the control signal of the agent in the format [[v1, omega1], [v2, omega2], ...].
- 'target_pos' is the target position of the agent in the format [x, y].
- 'obs_pos' is a list containing the vertex coordinates of multiple polygons, formatted as [[(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(x1,y1)],[...],...]. Each sublist represents the vertices of a polygon, the last vertex is the same as the first, indicating a closed polygon.
- 'agent_R' is the radius of the agent.
- 'state_info' is the state change of all agents from the initial moment to the current moment, formatted as [[[x11, y11,theta11], [x12, y12,theta12],...], [[x21, y21,theta21], [x22, y22,theta22],...],...]. (For example, `state_info[index]` records the state change of the agent `index` from the initial moment to the current moment.)



Assistant:
To solve this problem, we need to design a controller for multiple agents that enables them to navigate towards their respective targets while avoiding obstacles and other agents. The agents operate in a 2D environment with specific dynamics and constraints. The solution involves using a combination of attractive and repulsive forces to guide each agent towards its target while avoiding collisions.

### Approach
1. **Attractive Force**: Each agent is attracted towards its target position. This force is proportional to the distance between the agent and its target, encouraging the agent to move directly towards the goal.

2. **Repulsive Forces**:
   - **Obstacle Repulsion**: Each agent repels away from obstacles, which are defined as polygons. The closest point on each obstacle's edge is calculated, and a repulsive force is applied if the agent is within a safe distance from the obstacle.
   - **Agent Repulsion**: Agents repel each other to avoid collisions. If another agent is within a safe distance, a repulsive force is applied to maintain separation.

3. **Control Input Calculation**: The resultant force from the combination of attractive and repulsive forces determines the desired direction of movement. The linear velocity is set to a maximum value when the agent is far from the target and reduces as it approaches. The angular velocity is adjusted to align the agent's orientation with the desired direction.

### Explanation
1. **Attractive Force Calculation**: The agent is driven towards its target with a force proportional to the distance from the target.
2. **Obstacle Repulsion**: For each obstacle polygon, the closest point on each edge is found. If within a safe distance, a repulsive force is applied away from the obstacle.
3. **Agent Repulsion**: Each agent repels other agents within a safe distance to avoid collisions.
4. **Resultant Force and Control**: The resultant force vector determines the desired direction. The angular velocity adjusts the agent's orientation to align with this direction, while the linear velocity moves the agent forward, ensuring it reaches the target efficiently while avoiding obstacles and other agents.
