System:

You are an expert in designing controllers. Your task is to: 
- Analyze the given prompt and design a controller for the agent based on the provided information. 
- Implement the controller in Python, adhering to the specific format given in the prompt. 
- Ensure the controller enables the agent to avoid obstacles and other agents while successfully reaching its target.


User:

There are `10` homogeneous agents, each with a radius of `0.25`. The agents follow the dynamics $\dot{\boldsymbol{x} } =f(\boldsymbol{x}) + g(\boldsymbol{x}) \boldsymbol{u}$, where $\boldsymbol{x} = [p_x, p_y,\theta]$ represents the agent's position $(p_x,p_y)$ and orientation $\theta$ in a 2D space, and $\boldsymbol{u} = [v, \omega]$ represents the control inputs, with $v$ as the linear velocity and $\omega$ as the angular velocity. The initial states of the agents are`[[1.5, 0.5, 1.57], [3.5, 0.5, 1.57], [4.5, 0.5, 1.57], [6.5, 0.5, 1.57], [8.5, 0.5, 1.57], [9.5, 0.5, 1.57], [11.5, 0.5, 1.57], [14.5, 0.5, 1.57], [15.5, 0.5, 1.57], [18.5, 0.5, 1.57]]`, with their initial controls are `[[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Each agent has a known target point at `[[18, 19], [17, 19], [15, 19], [12, 19], [10, 19], [9, 19], [7.5, 19], [5, 19], [3, 19], [1, 19]]` (stop moving when the agent reaches the target point or gets sufficiently close to it). The positions of the obstacles are given as `[[(15.2, 8.3), (16.6, 12.0), (12.8, 12.6), (12.3, 11.9), (12.4, 9.0), (15.2, 8.3)], [(3.3, 6.8), (7.9, 6.3), (8.9, 7.6), (4.2, 8.0), (3.3, 6.8)], [(15.8, 2.5), (13.2, 6.4), (14, 3.2), (15.8, 2.5)], [(7.2, 11.2), (4.2, 17.4), (4.2, 12.0), (7.2, 11.2)], [(0.9, 5.2), (0.2, 3.2), (1.2, 1.8), (2.4, 1.3), (0.9, 5.2)], [(17.5, 6.1), (19.4, 5.3), (19.8, 5.8), (18.1, 6.1), (17.5, 6.1)]]`, each sublist represents the vertices of a polygon, with each vertex stored in the form of `(x, y)`. The last vertex is the same as the first, indicating a closed polygon.

Please help design a controller and implement it as Python function. The function should output the control input signal needed to update the agent's state. The time interval for the agent's state update is `0.05`. The function should return the control signal. Please design the controller using the following Python function structure and do not need the `example usage`:

```
def get_control(index,all_state,all_ctrl,target_pos,obs_pos,agent_R, state_info):
        # Your code to compute the control input
        return control_input
```

Where:

- 'index' is the agent index, starting from 0.
- 'all_state' is the current state of all the agents in the format [[x1, y1,theta1], [x2, y2,theta2], ...].
- 'all_ctrl' is the control signal of the agent in the format [[v1, omega1], [v2, omega2], ...].
- 'target_pos' is the target position of the agent in the format [x, y].
- 'obs_pos' is a list containing the vertex coordinates of multiple polygons, formatted as [[(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(x1,y1)],[...],...]. Each sublist represents the vertices of a polygon, the last vertex is the same as the first, indicating a closed polygon.
- 'agent_R' is the radius of the agent.
- 'state_info' is the state change of all agents from the initial moment to the current moment, formatted as [[[x11, y11,theta11], [x12, y12,theta12],...], [[x21, y21,theta21], [x22, y22,theta22],...],...]. (For example, `state_info[index]` records the state change of the agent `index` from the initial moment to the current moment.)



Assistant:
To solve this problem, we need to design a controller for multiple agents that enables them to navigate towards their respective targets while avoiding obstacles and each other. The agents have non-holonomic dynamics, meaning they can only move forward and turn, which adds complexity to their navigation.

### Approach
The controller uses a combination of potential fields to handle target attraction, obstacle repulsion, and inter-agent repulsion. Here's the breakdown of the approach:

1. **Target Attraction**: Each agent is driven towards its target by a proportional control force. The direction to the target is calculated, and the agent adjusts its angular velocity to align with this direction while moving forward with a constant linear velocity.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**: The agent repels away from obstacles by calculating the closest point on each obstacle's edges. If the agent is within a certain distance from an obstacle, a repulsive force is applied to steer it away.

3. **Inter-Agent Collision Avoidance**: Agents maintain a safe distance from each other by applying repulsive forces proportional to their proximity. This ensures that agents do not collide while navigating towards their targets.

### Solution Code

### Explanation
- **Target Attraction**: The agent calculates the direction to its target and generates an attractive force proportional to this direction.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: For each obstacle polygon, the agent computes the closest point on each edge and generates a repulsive force if within a threshold distance.
- **Inter-Agent Repulsion**: Each agent generates a repulsive force to maintain a safe distance from other agents, preventing collisions.
- **Control Adjustments**: The angular velocity is adjusted to steer the agent towards the resultant direction of all forces, while the linear velocity is reduced in proximity to obstacles or other agents to ensure safe navigation.

This approach ensures that each agent efficiently navigates towards its target while dynamically avoiding obstacles and other agents, leveraging potential fields to balance attraction and repulsion forces.
