System:

You are an expert in designing controllers. Your task is to: 
- Analyze the given prompt and design a controller for the agent based on the provided information. 
- Implement the controller in Python, adhering to the specific format given in the prompt. 
- Ensure the controller enables the agent to avoid obstacles and other agents while successfully reaching its target.


User:

There are `10` homogeneous agents, each with a radius of `0.25`. The agents follow the dynamics $\dot{\boldsymbol{x} } =f(\boldsymbol{x}) + g(\boldsymbol{x}) \boldsymbol{u}$, where $\boldsymbol{x} = [p_x, p_y,\theta]$ represents the agent's position $(p_x,p_y)$ and orientation $\theta$ in a 2D space, and $\boldsymbol{u} = [v, \omega]$ represents the control inputs, with $v$ as the linear velocity and $\omega$ as the angular velocity. The initial states of the agents are`[[1.5, 0.5, 1.57], [3.5, 0.5, 1.57], [4.5, 0.5, 1.57], [6.5, 0.5, 1.57], [8.5, 0.5, 1.57], [9.5, 0.5, 1.57], [11.5, 0.5, 1.57], [14.5, 0.5, 1.57], [15.5, 0.5, 1.57], [18.5, 0.5, 1.57]]`, with their initial controls are `[[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`. Each agent has a known target point at `[[18, 19], [17, 19], [15, 19], [12, 19], [10, 19], [9, 19], [7.5, 19], [5, 19], [3, 19], [1, 19]]` (stop moving when the agent reaches the target point or gets sufficiently close to it). The positions of the obstacles are given as `[[(15.2, 8.3), (16.6, 12.0), (12.8, 12.6), (12.3, 11.9), (12.4, 9.0), (15.2, 8.3)], [(3.3, 6.8), (7.9, 6.3), (8.9, 7.6), (4.2, 8.0), (3.3, 6.8)], [(15.8, 2.5), (13.2, 6.4), (14, 3.2), (15.8, 2.5)], [(7.2, 11.2), (4.2, 17.4), (4.2, 12.0), (7.2, 11.2)], [(0.9, 5.2), (0.2, 3.2), (1.2, 1.8), (2.4, 1.3), (0.9, 5.2)], [(17.5, 6.1), (19.4, 5.3), (19.8, 5.8), (18.1, 6.1), (17.5, 6.1)]]`, each sublist represents the vertices of a polygon, with each vertex stored in the form of `(x, y)`. The last vertex is the same as the first, indicating a closed polygon.

Please help design a controller and implement it as Python function. The function should output the control input signal needed to update the agent's state. The time interval for the agent's state update is `0.05`. The function should return the control signal. Please design the controller using the following Python function structure and do not need the `example usage`:

```
def get_control(index,all_state,all_ctrl,target_pos,obs_pos,agent_R, state_info):
        # Your code to compute the control input
        return control_input
```

Where:

- 'index' is the agent index, starting from 0.
- 'all_state' is the current state of all the agents in the format [[x1, y1,theta1], [x2, y2,theta2], ...].
- 'all_ctrl' is the control signal of the agent in the format [[v1, omega1], [v2, omega2], ...].
- 'target_pos' is the target position of the agent in the format [x, y].
- 'obs_pos' is a list containing the vertex coordinates of multiple polygons, formatted as [[(x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(x1,y1)],[...],...]. Each sublist represents the vertices of a polygon, the last vertex is the same as the first, indicating a closed polygon.
- 'agent_R' is the radius of the agent.
- 'state_info' is the state change of all agents from the initial moment to the current moment, formatted as [[[x11, y11,theta11], [x12, y12,theta12],...], [[x21, y21,theta21], [x22, y22,theta22],...],...]. (For example, `state_info[index]` records the state change of the agent `index` from the initial moment to the current moment.)



Assistant:
To solve this problem, we need to design a controller for multiple agents that enables them to reach their target positions while avoiding obstacles and other agents. The controller must compute linear and angular velocities for each agent based on their current state, the states of other agents, and the positions of obstacles.

### Approach
1. **Goal Seeking**: Each agent is attracted towards its target using a proportional control approach. The direction towards the target is computed and normalized to create an attractive force.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Repulsive forces are generated from obstacles based on the minimum distance to the edges of obstacle polygons. The repulsion strength increases as the agent gets closer to an obstacle.
3. **Inter-Agent Collision Avoidance**: Repulsive forces are also generated from other agents to maintain a safe distance. The repulsion strength increases as the distance to another agent decreases.
4. **Combining Forces**: The total force acting on an agent is the sum of the attractive force towards the target and the repulsive forces from obstacles and other agents. This total force determines the desired direction of movement.
5. **Control Inputs**: The linear velocity is adjusted based on proximity to the target and obstacles, while the angular velocity is set to align the agent's orientation with the desired direction.

### Explanation
1. **Goal Seeking**: The agent calculates the direction towards its target and normalizes this vector to create an attractive force scaled by a gain factor.
2. **Obstacle Avoidance**: For each edge of each obstacle polygon, the closest point to the agent is computed. If within a safe distance, a repulsive force is generated away from the obstacle.
3. **Inter-Agent Collision Avoidance**: Each agent generates a repulsive force from other agents within a safe distance, scaled by the inverse square of the distance.
4. **Combining Forces**: The total force vector is the sum of attractive and repulsive forces, determining the desired movement direction.
5. **Control Inputs**: The angular velocity adjusts the agent's orientation towards the desired direction, while the linear velocity is modulated based on proximity to the target and obstacles to ensure smooth and safe navigation.
